### Volatility

> Volatility refers to the amount of uncertainty or risk. A higher volatility means that a security's value can potentially be spread out over a larger range of values. This means that the price can change dramatically over a short time period in either direction. A lower volatility means that price does not fluctuate dramatically, but changes in value at a steady pace over a period of time.

> One measure of the relative volatility of a particular stock to the market is its beta. A beta approximates the overall volatility of a security's returns against the returns of a relevant benchmark( like S&P 500). For example, a stock with a beta
value of 1.1 has historically moved 110% for every 100% move in the benchmark.
