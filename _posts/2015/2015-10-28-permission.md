### File Permission

The file permissions bits include an execute permission bit for file owner, group and other. When the execute bit for the owner is set to "s". This causes any persons or processes that run the file to have access to system resources as though they are the owner of the file.

When the execute bit for the group is set to "s", the set group ID bit is set and the user running the program is given access based on access permission for the group the file belongs to.
